Morning Star will buy and sell cryptocurrencies on almost any major market based on the operator's conditions which are heavily customizable and templated. Multiple buying strategies are currently available with a single general selling strategy. Paper trading is available and requires minimal editing of code. The program will track the cryptocurrency's current price compared to the buy-in price and will report to the console. The console will report the details of every trade and the percentage change between the buy price and the selling price. It has the function to also average together all trades for a cumulative percentage change between money spent and money gained.
